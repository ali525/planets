        <h>Welfare spending cuts ‘rips hearts out of community’, says author</h>
        <hr>
        <h9>Ali Ingersoll and Lucas Marchesini</h9>
        <hr>
        <p>School children in navy sweaters file out of a building in South Wales, meeting their parents on the pavement where they start to excitedly discuss what they learned that day.</p>
        <p>Students in this school and millions of others around the United Kingdom are growing up under the age of austerity.</p>
        <p>The U.K. government has operated under a constricted budget since 2010 after George Osborne, the former chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced more than £40bn package filled with tax increases, welfare cuts, and Whitehall spending restraint aimed at supplementing the government’s budget deficit.</p>
        <p>“It pays for the past. And it plans for the future,” said Osborne during his 2010 budget statement he delivered to the House of Commons. “It supports a strong enterprise-led recovery. It rewards work. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society.”</p>
        <p>While the U.K. economy has grown for nine consecutive years under austerity spending, those who are living under it says it comes at a cost – and it’s the very people Osborne said it would protect.</p>
        <p>“It’s vulnerable people and marginalized people that mostly get hurt,” said Mary O’Hara, the author of ‘Austerity Bites.’  “They’re always the people who mostly get hurt and for some reason we find that acceptable as a society.”</p>
        <p>The government has reduced funding to several social welfare programs over the last nine years as schools have seen the number of students who qualify for school lunches increase during that same time frame.</p>
        <p>The cuts to education have been indirect. During this age of austerity, each school has less per pupil - in England, on average, spending has decreased by £474.14 and in Wales, the spending on each student is down by £602.</p>
        <img class=guto src="style/guto.jpg" width="480" alt="Guto Ifan, researcher, says austerity spending was a choice" title="Researcher at Wales Governance Centre"/>
        <p>“It was made out to be sort of a necessity but in actual fact, it was a choice to cut spending as quickly as they did,” said Guto Ifan, a Wales Governance Centre research assistant who analyzes austerity’s impact on local funding.</p>
        <p>While the Department for Education and National Health Services have not had their funding directly cut, other programs experiencing deficiencies partnered with a growing population, have led to a decrease in funding per pupil.</p>
        <p>When questioned about the issue, the Department for Education did not answer questions about the decrease on the spending on students but recognized “the budgeting challenges schools face”.</p>
        <p>“That is why the Education Secretary has set out his determination to work with the sector to help schools ensure that every pound is spent as effectively as possible to give children a great education”, a spokesperson told us.</p>
        <p>“The education system has been mopping up some of the problems that have been caused by other austerity cuts,” said O’Hara.</p>
        <p>While the author and journalist believes there will be long-term effects from austerity spending, O’Hara feels families around the United Kingdom have been dealing with the fallout from cuts since austerity’s onset.</p>
        <p>“[Social welfare program spending cuts] has a domino effect on the pressures those families feel, on their capacity to deal with certain things. That doesn’t go away. It has to go somewhere, and it ends up at the schools.”</p>
        <p>O’Hara says educators are now picking up the pieces, working as mental health counselors and schools have become the only source of a sense of community for many children. Some of the examples she points to which have impacted children and families include closing playgrounds and community pools, shutting down libraries, and reducing funding for carers. O’Hara says the evidence of damage to communities from reducing funding is overwhelming and, she believes, too significant to change.</p>
        <p>“They have ripped a huge hole in the social fabric of society, in the local government, in the benefit system. They have ripped the heart of communities by cutting services.”</p>

      <h>Breaking down the Barnett Formula</h>
      <hr>
      <h9>Lucas Marchesini and Leia Reed</h9>
      <hr>
      <p>Funding for education in the UK follows something called the Barnett Formula. It states that any increase or reduction in expenditure in England will automatically lead to a proportionate increase or reduction in expenditure in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p>
      <p>This happens because education is devolved, which means that the allocation of the budget is done by the local governments and not by the central UK administration.</p>
      <div id="sankey_multiple">
      </div>
      <p>The formula allows each devolved administration to allocate funds as wants.</p>
      <p>The formula’s name comes from Joel Barnett, the former Chief Secretary to the treasury who created it 1978. Although it has been around for decades, its efficiency is highly disputed. Barnett himself said in an interview to the Telegraph in 2014 that the formula is a “terrible mistake” and that he is ashamed of having his name on it.</p>

          <h1>Families making up for austerity's shortfall</h1>
            <img class="dadPic" src="style/dad1.jpg" width="480" alt="Dad of triplets waits outside of school" title="Dad of three waits for children outside of a school"/>
            <p>Ben Pryer sits outside a school in Roath, waiting for his children to be dismissed for the day. The father of triplets lives in Cardiff. Two of them attend the same primary school while the third attend a special school for kids with autism.</p>
            <p>This very particular situation allows him to directly see the impact of austerity. “A lot of schools are not able anymore to offer additional help to kids with special needs”, he says while waiting for his two daughters finish their school day.</p>
            <p>“Schools need more resources. In many occasion teachers spend their own money for things”, he adds.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the effect of budget cuts in education, parents are one of the factors in an equation that includes teachers, the government and kids.</p>
            <p>A survey released last year by the National Education Union interviewed 900 of its members to find out if parents were been asked for money to help with school funding. One third of them said that it happened in their school.</p>
            <p>According to the survey, it happens for example in buying textbooks that schools cannot offer anymore.</p>

        <p>Impact on education is profound</p>
      </div>

      <div id='data' class="details">
        <h2>Data and Methodology</h2>
        <p>The data used in this investigation has two main sources: <a href="https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/download-data"> the Department for Education</a> (DfE) when it comes to English schools and <a href="https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Local-Government/Finance/Revenue/Delegated-School-Budgets/delegatedschoolbudgets-by-school"> StatWales </a> for information about Wales. In both cases, the information was separated by school.</p>
        <p>To measure the effects of austerity on spending per pupil per school in the two countries, the data was clustered in two periods: the 8 years of Austerity, starting with the first budget of David Cameron government (2010-2011) to the last Tory administration with available data (2017-2018).</p>
        <p>The eight year period was compared to one timeframe with the same extension ending in 2009-2010 and starting in 2002-2003.</p>
        <p>All values were adjusted by the inflation in the period according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) of 58.48% (CPS).</p>
        <p>An important methodology information regarding the spending per pupil by ethnicity is that masked data of the number of pupils of a specific ethnicity was replaced by 1 when required.</p>
        <p>This happened because the DfE masks the number of pupils of a ethnicity in a school when there are only one or two of that ethnicity in the establishment. The same procedure was applied to Wales data.</p>
